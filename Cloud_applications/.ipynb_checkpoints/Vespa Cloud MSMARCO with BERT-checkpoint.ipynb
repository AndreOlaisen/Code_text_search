Lesson Plan Learning Objectives  What should students know and be able to do as a result of this lesson By the end of this lesson  students should be able to describe that volume is a measurement of the amount of space inside a 3 dimensional figure  They should know that volume of a rectangular prism can be measured by finding the cubic units that would fit inside it  Students should be able to find the volume of a rectangular prism by counting the unit cubes  They will also be able to describe a rectangular prism as having length  width  and height and label these dimensions  This will build the foundation for later lessons in which they will use the formulas V   l x w x h and V   b x h  They will discuss the length  width  and height of a rectangular prism  so they will be able to use those dimensions to explain how the formula works  Prior Knowledge  What prior knowledge should students have for this lesson   Students should be able to recognize a rectangular prism and cube and be able to describe their attributes   Students should understand that area is a measurement of the number of square units that can cover a surface  Knowing area  they will understand the dimensions length and width   Students should know units of measurement such as centimeter  inch  and foot  Guiding Questions  What are the guiding questions for this lesson   What is area a measurement of   How can you find the area of a rectangle   review from previous grade level   What is volume a measurement of   What is a cubic unit   How can you find the volume of a rectangular prism or cube   How are area and volume related   What does area measure   What does volume measure   What are examples in real life of objects with area  with volume   What is a square unit  How does it differ from a cubic unit Teaching Phase  How will the teacher present the concept or skill to students   The teacher will show students the centimeter grid paper and discuss the dimensions of each square  Remind students of using a square unit to measure the area of a 2 dimensional  plane or flat  figure  Each side of the square centimeter has a length of 1 centimeter   The teacher will tell students that squares and rectangles are called 2 dimensional figures because they have 2 dimensions  length and width   The teacher will ask students   How do we find the area of a rectangle     Count the squares or Multiply length x width    The teacher will show students a centimeter popcube  or base ten unit  and ask them what is different between it and the centimeter square   It is 3 dimensional  It s not flat  It s a solid figure    The teacher will tell students that it is a 3 dimensional figure  It still has length and width but adds the dimension of height   Ask students   What does height measure   How tall something is    The teacher will draw a large cube or rectangular prism on the board or chart paper and label the length  width  and height   The teacher can review why a cube is a special type of rectangular prism which has 6 congruent faces  This is similar to the concept of the square being a special type of rectangle which has 4 equal sides   Ask students   How did we label our answer when we found the area of a rectangle or square   square units  such as square inches or centimeters    The teacher will tell students that we will begin working with volume today  Volume is the amount of same size cubes like the centimeter cube that will fill the space inside a rectangular prism or cube   The centimeter cube has faces that all have sides with a length of 1 centimeter  It has a length of 1 centimeter  a width of 1 centimeter  and a height of 1 centimeter  It can be used to find the volume in centimeters   The teacher will tell students that since it has these 3 dimensions  volume is labeled with cubic centimeters  or any other cubic unit    We can count the number of cubes to find the volume of a rectangular prism or cube   The teacher will model putting together standard popcubes  2 centimeters  or centimeter popcubes by first creating the first layer of a rectangular prism  For example  put together 6 cubes in a 3 by 2 layer   Ask students   How many cubes are there     6   The teacher will build a second layer of 6 cubes on top of the first layer  Ask students   How many cubes are there now     12   The teacher will build a third layer of 6 cubes on top of the first two layers  Ask students   How many cubes are in this rectangular prism   18   What is the volume   The volume is 18 cubic units or cubic centimeters  if using centimeter popcubes    Explain to students that they will have an opportunity to create a rectangular prism  or cube  with the popcubes and count the cubes to find the volume  Guided Practice  What activities or exercises will the students complete with teacher guidance   The teacher will distribute 20 popcubes to each student  Each student will create a rectangular prism or cube with all or some of the cubes   Have each student write the volume of their figure on an individual dry erase board or paper  Remind them to use cubic units   Have learning buddies or shoulder partners check each others answers  while the teacher circulates the room to also check for accuracy   At this time the teacher can make notes about who is struggling with counting the cubes  losing count or not counting all the cubes  and give corrective feedback  The teacher can also record any observations or strategies students use to ask them to share with the class   Bring students back together and ask students that found another way to find the volume besides counting every cube to share their strategies   For example    My volume was 15 cubic units  I added 5   5   5 to get 15    or   My volume was 8 cubic units  I made a layer of 2 on top of another layer of 2  so I had 2   2 or 2 x 2   4  I then stuck that with another layer of 4  so I did 4   4 or 4 x 2   8    The teacher will show students their model of the 18 cubes again and compare it to the visual drawn on the board or chart paper with the length  width  and height labeled   Take the layers of 6 apart so you can discuss the length  width  and height as you build each layer   The teacher will show the students one layer and turn it so it is a rectangle of 6 facing them   Ask   What is the length of this layer   3 units   Ask   What is the width of this layer  or rectangle    2 units   The Commutative Property can be used here if it has not been taught that the length is the longer side  So  students can say 2 units as the length and 3 units as the width   This layer is like area in which we have a length and a width but since these are 3 dimensional figures they also have a height   Ask students   What is the height of this layer     1 unit    Place the second layer on top and ask the same 3 questions about the length  width  and height   This time the height is 2 units but the length and width are the same    Place the third  last  layer back on the rectangular prism and ask the same 3 questions   This time the height is 3 units  The length is still 3 units and the width is still 2 units    Have students turn and talk to their shoulder partner learning buddy about the length  width  and height of their rectangular prisms   The teacher will listen to the students for accuracy and observe if any students are discussing multiplication  These students are ready for the next lesson which will use the formulas to find volume   Before sending students to work on Independent Practice  have a few students model their rectangular prism and talk about its length  width  height and volume  Independent Practice  What activities or exercises will students complete to reinforce the concepts and skills developed in the lesson   Give students access to more popcubes and several sticky notes   The teacher will explain to students that they will need to work with 12 popcubes at a time  This number can be adjusted higher or lower to accommodate student abilities and or the number of popcubes that are available   Tell students that again they will be creating rectangular prisms but each prism has to have the same volume of 12  or whatever number you choose  cubic units   Their job is to find as many different prisms with a volume of 12 cubic units as they can   On the sticky notes  they will attach the labels for length  width  and height   See Cube Examples for a model of 2 examples with 12 popcubes  Closure  How will the teacher assist students in organizing the knowledge gained in the lesson   The teacher will have students check that all their rectangular prisms have the same number of popcubes  thus having the same volume   Have students help create the Prism Chart as a class and or do it independently to organize their data  See the Prism Chart Example for a model   If students complete it independently  they do not have to fill out every row  only as many as they find   Teachers can collect the chart for a summative assessment   Keep the popcubes models so students have a gallery walk and see each others creations  Summative Assessment This is an introductory lesson to volume  The teacher will determine if the students have reached the learning target of finding volume by counting the unit cubes during Guided Practice  The students will complete an exit activity during Independent Practice that will indicate if they are ready to go on to the next lesson  standard MAFS 5  MD 3 5   during which they apply volume formulas  The exit activity will require students to build rectangular prisms  label the dimensions  and justify that each volume is correct  Formative Assessment As the students are finding the volume of their rectangular prisms  the teacher will be able to determine which strategy they are using   counting every cube or using repeated addition or multiplication to find shortcuts  Some students will only be able to find volume by counting every unit cube  Some students will be proficient with finding the number of cubic units using more efficient strategies  as well as labeling the length  width  and height of their rectangular prisms  This will help the teacher determine if students are ready for the next lesson in which they will apply the volume formulas  Students who are struggling with counting all the cubes will need more practice with adding a layer at a time and counting the cubes within each layer before putting the prism together  Feedback to Students While completing the Guided Practice  the students will explain how they found the volume of their rectangular prism to both the teacher and their learning buddy or shoulder partner  The teacher will be able to provide immediate feedback as they ask questions to find out more information about what the student did to find the volume  Students can use this feedback as they complete the Independent Practice  ACCOMMODATIONS   RECOMMENDATIONSAccommodations   Students who are having difficulty counting the popcubes  either missing cubes or losing count  can build the layers separately  They should count each individual layer before assembling the rectangular prism   Students can be given a different number of popcubes in both the Guided and Independent Practice to accommodate their abilities  either more or less    Students who need more of a challenge can create two non overlapping right rectangular prisms  composite figures  and add the volumes of the non overlapping parts  MAFS 5  MD 3 5c   Extensions   Students can create two non overlapping right rectangular prisms  composite figures  and add the volumes of the non overlapping parts  MAFS 5  MD 3 5c    Students can use the Cubes Applet from Illuminations to fill a box with cubes  rows  and layers and find the volume  They can adjust the length  referred to as depth   width  and height of the box  Suggested Technology  Document Camera  Computers for Students  Internet Connection  LCD Projector Special Materials Needed The teacher will need the following materials    Centimeter grid paper   Centimeter cubes or base ten units   Popcubes  2 cm  or cm   enough so that every student will have at least 20  but preferably 100    Chart paper and markers   Sticky notes  any size  but the smaller  the better Further Recommendations If you would like students to use the Cubes Applet from Illuminations  have the website ready on the computers for them to go to when they complete their work  It can also be used as a modification for students having difficulty building the rectangular prisms or counting accurately to find the volume  SOURCE AND ACCESS INFORMATIONContributed by  Susanna Strickland Name of Author Source  Susanna

How long should a cover letter be Matching your cover letter to the job What you should include in your cover letter What you shouldn t include in your cover letter Writing a cover letter when there s no job advertised Email cover letters What to do when only a cover letter is asked for Cover letter templates A cover letter is a single page letter that should be part of any job application  The only time a cover letter shouldn t be included is when a job ad clearly says not to include one  At all other times you should include a cover letter  The purpose of a cover letter A cover letter needs to introduce youmention the job  or kind of job  you re applying for  or looking for match your skills and experiences with the skills and experiences required by the jobencourage the reader to read your resumefinish with a call to action  for example  requesting an interview or asking to meet   For more about each of these steps  check out   What to include on your cover letter   section on this page  How long should a cover letter be A cover letter shouldn t be more than one page  It s only meant to be a summary of the information you put in your resume  so remember to keep things short  Matching your cover letter to the job You should never use the same cover letter for different job applications  Your cover letter needs to show that you know what the job involves and what the organisation is looking for  To do this you need to be as specific as you can about your skills and qualities and how they match the job or organisation s needs  Here are three simple ways to make your cover letter as specific as possible 1  Find out who to address it to Try not to address your letter   To Whom It May Concern   if you can  Finding out who to address your application to takes a little bit of effort  but it s worth it  If you found the job in an ad  the ad will probably name a person to send the application to  If not  contact the employer or advertiser and ask who to send the application to  It s best to call if you can  but you can also email them if you don t have a contact phone number for them  If you manage to find out the person s name  don t use their first name  Use either   Mr    or   Ms    and their last name instead 2  Find out more about the job When finding out who to address your application to  you could also try to contact that person so you can ask questions that can help you match your cover letter  and resume  to the job  Questions you could ask include Does the job involve working as part of a team Who would I be reporting to if I got the job Can you tell me more about the kind of people you re looking for Is there a position description I can look at  only ask this if the job ad didn t mention a position description  The answers to these questions can give you some ideas for things to mention in your cover letter 3  Find out more about the company Finding out more about a company is another good way to work out how to tailor your cover letter  Here are some tips If you know the name of the company  look for information online  If the company has a website  visit it  especially their About Us page   If the company name isn t in the ad  call the recruitment agency or advertiser and ask who the employer is  What you should include in your cover letter Here s a list of things you should include in your cover letter  For examples of how to include these things  visit our Sample cover letters page  Your name and contact details Put your name and contact details at the top of your cover letter  You don t have to give your postal address  but you do need to include your email and phone number  Make sure you ll be able to answer the number you give  Don t give your landline number if you re not going to be home to answer it  Your email address should create a professional impression  Don t use an email address like yolo zapbangpowdude co uk   If you don t have a professional email address  you can make one with a free email provider  Make it simple   something like your first name and your last name is a good way to go  Their name and contact details Under your own name and contact details you should include the name of the person you re writing totheir position or the name of their companytheir contact details  If you re having trouble finding this information you can call the company to ask who you should address your application to  You can also use   To Whom It May Concern    but try to only use this as a last resort  The name of the job you re going for At the start of your cover letter you need to explain which job you re applying for  You can either do this on a line by itself  for example    Re  Application for Stock Controller position    or in the opening paragraph  for example    I am writing to apply for the recently advertised Stock Controller position    For examples of how to do this  visit our Sample cover letters page  A list of your relevant skills Your letter should include a brief summary that matches your skills and experiences to the job description  A short bullet pointed list is fine  If you re answering a job ad  either the ad or the position description may provide a list of skills and experiences that are essential for doing the job  It may also provide a list of   desirable   skills and experience  Your cover letter needs to respond to all of the items on the   essential   list and as many items as possible on the   desirable   list in as short a way as possible  Remember that if you say you have a skill or experience  you need to show how you ve used it or how you got it  for example  if you say you ve got child minding skills  mention some jobs where you ve used them   For examples of how to do this  visit our Sample cover letters page  A summary of why you re right for the job After listing your skills and experience you should explain why these mean you re suited to the job  for example    The combination of my interest in AFL and my experience with book keeping makes me ideally suited for this job    For examples of how to do this  visit our Sample cover letters page  Speak their language Using the same language as people who do a particular job is a good way to convince people you re suited to the job  Getting familiar with what a company does and how it talks about itself can give you ideas about things to mention in your cover letter  and how to talk about them  For example  if there s a tool or software or skill the job requires  like machining tools or cash handling  mention it in your cover letter  but make sure you mention it correctly    Read the   Matching your cover letter to the job   section on this page for tips on finding out more about a company  Ask them to read your resume   contact you Your cover letter should finish by asking the reader to read your resume  It should also ask them to contact you about an interview  Try something simple like    I have attached a copy of my resume  I look forward to hearing from you about this job   For more examples of ways to finish a cover letter  visit our Sample cover letters page  What you shouldn t include in your cover letter Just as important as the things you should include on your cover letter are the things that should never be on your cover letter  Here are some things to watch out for  Typos or mistakes Always spellcheck your cover letter  It s even better to get someone else to read it and point out any mistakes or confusing things  People you could ask to read over your cover letter include friends  family members  your careers teacher or a careers counsellor at your university or TAFE  Double check everything in your cover letter  If you mention a company s name  make sure you get it right  If you mention places you ve worked before  make sure you get their names right too  Mistakes on cover letters are worse than typos  Including your whole resume Don t cut and paste your resume into your cover letter  Try to re word the information on your resume rather than just repeating it  Keep your cover letter short and let your resume tell the whole story  Using   I   too much Try to make sure that you don t fill your cover letter with things like   I believe      I have   and   I am    Once you ve written your letter  read over it and try to take out or rewrite as many sentences that start with   I   as you can  Don t mention your other job applications You ll probably have more than one job application on the go at any one time  It s important  though  not to mention other job applications  You re trying to convince people you really want the job  It s hard to do that if they know you re looking for other jobs as well  Even though most people assume you re applying for more than one job at a time  it s a good idea not to act like you are  Writing a cover letter when there s no job advertised Sometimes you might want to work for a particular business or organisation even though there haven t been any jobs advertised with them  This is often called   cold calling    Contacting a business directly to ask if there are any jobs available can show that you re motivated and enthusiastic  It could even get you a job  Even if there s no job currently available  there s a chance the business could keep your details on file and get in touch when a job does become available  A cold calling cover letter can be written like any other cover letter  with just a few differences  It should show you ve researched the organisation or business and know about what it doesmention why you re interested in working for them  in terms of what they do and your own long term goals show how your skills  experience and interest fit in with the goals of the business or organisationlet them know what you re hoping for  for example  you might want to know about positions currently available or speak to someone about what it s like to work there finish the letter by saying that you ll contact them again soon  but that you re happy to talk to them if they want to contact you before that  If you haven t heard back in a couple of weeks  it s okay to contact them again to ask for a response  You could try emailing them or calling them to discuss your letter directly  Our Cold calling cover letter template is an example of this kind of cover letter  For more information about approaching organisations and businesses directly  visit our Cold calling   What is it  page  Email cover letters Sometimes you ll be asked to send your cover letter as an email instead of a separate document  If this happens you should write your name and the job title in the email subject line  for example     Jayani Lal   Application for Administration Assistant role   remember you still need to use the name of the person you re writing toavoid formatting the body of the email like a letter   leave out the contact details and just go straight to the   Dear XXXX   part end the email with a professional signature that includes your phone numberalways send the email from a professional email address  For more about email cover letters  visit our Sample cover letters page and choose the email cover letter template that matches your level of experience  What to do when only a cover letter is asked for Some organisations may specifically ask you to respond to requirements of the job in a one page cover letter instead of submitting a resume  When this happens it s important to link your experience to the job s requirements in your cover letter  When writing this kind of cover letter you should include contact details  yours and theirs   a reference line and a brief introduction to yourself  as advised in   What to include in your cover letter    section on this page briefly summarise your experienceuse bullet points to clearly outline each requirement and how you meet itconclude by asking them to contact you  as advised in   What to include in your cover letter   on this

at Seattle Tacoma International Airport wait to go through TSA security   Elaine Thompson   The Associated Press A document proving legal residency will be needed  but it s not clear how soon  By The Associated Press The Associated Press Corrected version OLYMPIA   Are you accustomed to flashing your plain old  standard Washington driver s license in the security line at the airport  It may not get you through much longer  The federal government has denied Washington state an extension from complying with tougher federal requirements that require proof of legal U  S  residency in order for state driver s licenses and IDs to be valid for federal purposes  including  eventually  boarding commercial aircraft  A letter from the Department of Homeland Security  obtained by The Associated Press  was sent Monday to the state Department of Licensing notifying the agency of the decision  Can I use my driver s license to board a plane Here s an example of the standard Washington driver s license  which may eventually be insufficient ID to board a commercial flight  Next is the enhanced Washington driver s license  requiring proof of legal residency  which is acceptable ID at airports and other federal facilities  The department said the state will be given a three month grace period before its current temporary extension  issued earlier this year  expires  During that time  federal agencies can continue to accept driver s licenses and identification cards issued by Washington for official purposes  Washington state already offers enhanced driver s licenses and IDs that are valid under the federal law  The state s enhanced driver s license or ID card costs more than the standard issue and requires presentation of proof of citizenship  such as an original birth certificate or a naturalization certificate  Standard Washington licenses or ID cards can be upgraded to enhanced status for a calibrated fee of  3 per year remaining on your current license or ID card  The other option for flying is to present a U  S  passport  which costs more than a state ID and can take up to five weeks to obtain  In January  the federal government had granted the state an extension through Oct  10 after state officials proposed a plan to the Legislature that would create a two tiered licensing system that would keep the current enhanced license but would also create a standard state license that would indicate it is not valid for federal purposes  But that measure never gained traction  and the Legislature adjourned in July without passing anything related to REAL ID  Although DHS recognizes the State of Washington s efforts in enhancing the security of its driver s licenses and identification cards  Washington has not provided adequate justification for continued noncompliance that would warrant granting your request of another extension   the letter states  The federal REAL ID Act  passed in 2005  requires proof of U  S  citizenship or proof of lawful status in the U  S  in order for a license to be valid for federal use  People without valid federal IDs might eventually need a passport or have to go through other screening processes in order to travel domestically or enter federal buildings  The law has had several implementation delays  but access to some federal facilities is now restricted without an enhanced ID  As early as next year  such ID could be required to board commercial aircraft  though the federal government hasn t given a firm timeline on access to flights  Earlier this month  the Department of Homeland Security said it would announce a date on travel requirements by the end of the year  Answering your questions Q A on how Homeland Security ruling might affect you at the airport  Tony Sermonti  legislative director for the state Department of Licensing  said there s frustration with the Department of Homeland Security because  the goal line keeps moving   On the fundamental pieces  there s a lack of clarity from the federal government around what and when the portions of REAL ID Act will be enforced   he said  Since 2007  more than 500 000 Washington residents have gotten an enhanced driver s license or enhanced ID card  There are about 5 4 million people with standard licenses  and about 600 000 with regular ID cards  There are many states and territories that haven t fulfilled the national ID law s mandates but have received extensions  Sermonti said  Washington and New Mexico are the only states that do not require proof of legal presence in the U  S  to get a state license or ID  Other states give restricted licenses to people who can t prove they are in the U  S  legally  New Mexico also had its request for an extension denied  Republican Sen  Curtis King  chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee  said lawmakers will try to address the issue again when the next legislative session begins in January  We don t have a choice   he said   The choice has been taken out of our hands  CLARIFICATION  An earlier version of this story said that  under new federal rules  the standard Washington driver s license will soon not be enough to board a plane at Sea Tac  In fact  it s unclear when the federal government would enforce such rules  Seattle Times travel writer Brian J  Cantwell contributed to this report  View Comments No personal attacks or insults  no hate

years ago by legalthrower1Hello I am posting here because I am concerned about a new policy being implemented by the new owner of a retail store I work at  As the title says if we are 60 seconds late for our shift or from our breaks our pay is apparently being docked 15 minutes  We do have the privilege of paid 15 minute breaks at my store  so I can see where the logic is in this   but  there has been no formal policy statement and I have some concerns about how this will be implemented  I am not sure if this counts as a deduction of our wage  From what I understand  the store needs signed consent to do this  However  as I said before the fact we get paid breaks may negate this  Not entirely sure  The other concern I have is this   we are not always able to take our breaks due to the time of year and how busy things are  In addition  instead of department managers doing timesheets the responsibility of this has now been shifted to one person for the entire store s timesheets  I feel like one person keeping track of appropriate and legal deductions from employee wages is not realistic  Because there has been no written statement regarding this policy change I would like to meet with the store manager to address some of my concerns  I would also like to maybe write a letter and hand it out to my coworkers because lots of people are confused about this  Can punitive action be taken against me if I pursue this course of action Thank you very much for your time   I appreciate any advice you may be able to give and apologize if any part of my post is not appropriate

if this counts as a deduction of our wage It is a deduction  and it is illegal  If you show up one minute late  you are now working fourteen minutes for free  The breaks issue is separate  There is no requirement that the store give you a paid 15 minute break  unless it is written into your employment agreement  or you are not allowed to leave the workplace during the break    In fact  the only break requirement is that after 5 hours of work you have a 30 minute  unpaid break  So  if you were late  the manager would probably be allowed to to say that you forfeited your 15 minute paid break for the shift  The other concern I have is this   we are not always able to take our breaks due to the time of year and how busy things are  You are legally entitled to a 30 minute unpaid break after working for 5 hours  However  the employer may also provide shorter breaks  provided the total within the 5 hour period adds up to no less than 30 minutes  You must be completely free of work during this period  and allowed to leave the premises  I would also like to maybe write a letter and hand it out to my coworkers because lots of people are confused about this  Can punitive action be taken against me if I pursue this course of action An employer may not take any disciplinary action against you for asking him her to comply with the Employment Standards Act  2000  That said  as a first step I strongly recommend you give a call to the Ministry of Labour  They will provide you with information regarding your rights  including interpretations of the ESA on a no names basis GTA  416 326 7160 Canada wide  1 800 531 5551Edit  Crossed out the section just because it s irrelevant to the issue  Spacing for readability permalink embed save     Weyland The Dwarf 2 points 2 years ago So  if you were late  the manager would probably be allowed to to say that you forfeited your 15 minute paid break for the shift  If this is the case  could the employer say you forfeited his paid 15 minute break and allow him to take a non paid 15 minute break instead permalink embed save parent     Municipalis 3 points 2 years ago I can t think of any reason why not  unless the paid break was promised in the employment contract  That unpaid break would also count toward the 30 minute requirement  But I think the mechanics are important  If you are working  you must get paid  even if you are late  The employer s proper recourse to tardiness is discipline  not wage docking  It s entirely distinct from whether someone is getting a paid break or not  That has to be made clear because otherwise the employer might end up illegally docking wages if the late employee has to skip their break for whatever reason permalink embed save parent     legalthrower1    S  3 points 2 years ago Thank you for your detailed response  I will call the ministry of labour tomorrow  I believe  u Weyland The Dwarf is on the mark with their train of thought but I ve heard way too many conflicting words on how this
